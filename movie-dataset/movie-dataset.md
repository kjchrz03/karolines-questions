## Introduction

What are the properties of high revenue films? Using data from The Movie Database (TMDb), I investigated the relationship between popularity, runtime, and vote average (rating) and the adjusted revenue of the films. To account for inflation, the adjusted revenue column reflects a film's revenue in 2010 dollars.

> * Has film revenue changed over time?
> * Are high revenue films more popular than low revenue films?
> * Is there a positive relationship between runtime and revenue? Is it worth it to produce a long film?
> * Are high revenue films highly rated?

df_movies = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\bsear\Desktop\Class Assignments\movies.csv")

## Data Wrangling

> A quick review of the dataset tells me what data types I have, if there are null values, and what kind of clean-up, if any, is needed before evaluation.

> At first glance, it appears that all of the variables I want to investigate are populated with data. Before I take a closer look at those columns, I removed the columns "ID", "IMDB ID", "Homepage", "Tagline", and "Overview". Since I am not using those variables in my evaluation, I took those out in order to keep the dataframe tidy and easy to read.

> I kept other columns, such as titles, directors, cast, genres, production companies, and release dates in case those variables provide additional insights later on.

> After closer inspection, I had to clean the runtime and adjusted revenue columns.

> __Thought:__ It appears that, while there are more movies made in later decades, the mean adjusted revenue is higher for earlier films. I decided to create this kind of visualization to compare the adjusted revenue means. The pie chart was interesting, but it really focused on the _count_ of movies. The scatter plot showed every film and it's adjusted revenue, but looking at individual films in this way is too detailed. This bar chart is a great visual to show, regardless of number of films produced each decade, which decade had the highest mean adjusted revenue. In short, it's a single visual that answers my question.

* This is a visualization I really like and plan to use again, so I will make a function here to reduce the repetition of the lengthy code.


```python
#defining my function
def bar_plot(locations, heights, labels, xlabel, ylabel, title):
    plt.bar(locations, heights, tick_label=labels)
    plt.xlabel(xlabel)
    plt.ylabel(ylabel)
    plt.title(title)
```


```python
#creating a list of labels
decades = list(df_movies['release_decade'].unique().dropna())
decades.sort(reverse=False)
decades
```




    ['1960s', '1970s', '1980s', '1990s', '2000s', '2010s']

> __Thought:__ Again, using this kind of visualization is a great way to see where difference exists. A pie chart might also be an interesting visual for this output, as well; particularly since there is one value much greater than the rest. I a little suprrised by the result. There is clearly a jump in revenue for "long" films. "Long" films are at least 1 hour and 51 minutes long.

## Conclusions

__1. Has film revenue changed over time?__

Yes, absolutely. I found it particularly interesting that the _number_ of films being made has increased, but the revenue is down. Movies released in the 1960s and 1970s were fewer in number but earned more at the boxoffice. Why?

* Fewer TVs? Less at-home entertainment could explain why revenue was higher in teh 1960s and 1970s.
* The rise of the VHS in the 1980s and the prevalence of at-home movie consumption in the 1990s and 2000s could explain the drop in revenue despite the increased number of film releases.

> Limitation: I am making an educated guess as to why films brought in higher revenue in the 1960s and 1970s. An additonal dataset with information about at-home entertainment systems would be an interesting evaluation. Is there a correlation? 

> Limitation: Were people going to the movies more often back in teh 1960s and 1970s? This dataset may record "popularity" but it doesn't necessarily indicate how may people attended these movies.

__2. Are high revenue films more popular than low revenue films?__

As expected, yes, high revenue films are popular films. It is an easy assumption to make that, if people like a film, they will invest in it more, either by seeing it in the theatre multiple times and/or purchasing the film.

> Limitation: high revenue films are popular, but are popular films high earners? It would be a good idea to confirm this. Are both variables predictors of the other?

> Limitation: the variable "popularity" is a somewhat vague variable and I could not find much information online about how TMDb defines popularity. Is it the number of people who see the film? The number of times it plays? How many copies of the film people buy? How long the film is in theatres? Or is it another measure? While the relationship between popularity and revenue doesn't change, the meaning of the results could change if the variable is more clearly defined.

__3. Is there a positive relationship between runtime and revenue?__

There is a positive relationship between runtime and revenue. You can clearly see in the bar graph how much higher revenue is for the "long" film runtime.

* I was surprised by this result at first, as I wasn't sure there would be a well-defined relationship at all.
* I also expected that if there was a relationship, I didn't think long films would necessarily be popular.

> Limitations: Time is relative and subjective. Using runtime as a variable may be useful in determining the minimum and maximum film runtime to get the most return on investment, but people's definitions of a "long" or "short" film may vary. 

> Liminations: After looking at the data more closely, 111 minutes (1 hour 51 minutes) isn't really that long (to me). As I mentioned above, movie time length can be subjective and others may think a 2 hour film is long. If I did this analysis again, I might categorize the lengths differently or change the minute runtime into hour runtimes.

__4. Are high revenue films highly rated?__

Yes, high revenue films also receive high ratings. I was a little surprised at these findings; just because a movie brings in a lot of money doesn't automatically make it a "good" film. Then again, this is a subjective measure. 

>Limitations: Just like with the "popularity" variable, TMDb doesn't define "average rating" in this dataset. I made the assumption that it was a film rating.

## Final Thoughts

This dataset was very interesting to work with and there are many ways to measure the characteristics of a high revenue film than the ones I used. If I were to do this project over, I would re-consider some of the variables I chose to evaluate my questions. The dataset could be improved with more information about some of the variables, such as popularity and average ratings. While the lack of a definition doesn't affect the calculations, it can affect the story I tell with the data.
